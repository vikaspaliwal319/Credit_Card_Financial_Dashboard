# Project: Credit Card Financial Dashboard

## Project Objective
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyse credit card operations effectively.

## Data Sources
The data for the Credit Card Financial Dashboard project originates from two primary tables within our MySQL database:
#### Customer Details Table:
  - Demographic information about customers, including age, gender, income level, and geographic location.

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data integrity by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Integration**: Combine relevant fields from both tables to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Perform necessary transformations such as aggregations, calculations, and formatting to prepare the data for visualization.
- **Dashboard Design**: Design the layout and components of the dashboard, including charts, tables, and filters.
- **Dashboard Development**: Implement the dashboard using a suitable tool like Tableau, Power BI, or custom web development.
- **Testing and Validation**: Verify the accuracy and functionality of the dashboard by conducting thorough testing.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the dashboard to a suitable platform for access by stakeholders.
